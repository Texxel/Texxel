# Texxel

Texxel is still in heavy development, but it plans to become a clone of Pixel Dungeon. 

The difference beteen this and the original is that this version plans on being written with a
focus on easy to understand and flexible code instead of good performance. Thus, writting mods for 
it will be easy. Furthermore, there are plans on adding a plugin system so mods can play together.
