# Texxel

Texxel is still in heavy development, but it plans to become a clone of Pixel Dungeon. 

The primary difference between this and the original is that this version plans on adding
a plugin system so that mods can be installed and used together.

Texxel also aims to be written with a focus on easy to understand, well documented and 
flexible code. Performance shall also try to be optimised, by only when it doesn't interfere
with good api. Hopefully, writing mods for will be easy and we'll see all sorts of cool things evolve :)
